# Newsfeed Components &mdash; Lambda School Project

A simple **newsfeed application** constructed from JavaScript "components", which:

- Renders _expandable_ and _collapsible_ newsfeed components – which are composed of lorem text – to the screen.
- Uses pre-defined data from an array of objects.
